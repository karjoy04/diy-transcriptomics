DIY Transcriptomics: RNA-seq Analysis  
Course link: https://diytranscriptomics.com/  


Welcome to my DIY Transcriptomics project repository! This repository contains code, scripts, and notes from my journey through the RNA-seq analysis section of the DIY transcriptomics course. The aim is to apply the concepts learned and create a resource for future reference. I also used harrisonized/diy-transcriptomics github repository as a supplement to help me with parts that are hard to follow and reproduce for custom analysis. 
I will also try to diverge and see if I can analyze/visualize the data partly in Python to compare the usability and comfort. 


Project Structure
/data: Raw and processed data files used in the analysis.  
/scripts: Custom scripts for processing RNA-seq data, including quality control, alignment, quantification, and differential expression analysis.  
/notebooks: Jupyter notebooks documenting the step-by-step analysis process, with explanations and visualizations.  
/results: Output files from the analysis, such as count matrices, plots, and differential expression results.  
/docs: Notes and additional documentation related to the RNA-seq analysis.  

Tools & Packages  
This project uses the following tools and packages:  
Python: For scripting, data analysis, visulaization.  
R: For statistical analysis and visualization.  
Bioconductor: R packages for analyzing high-throughput genomic data.  
DESeq2: Differential expression analysis.  
STAR: RNA-seq read aligner.  
FastQC: Quality control for high-throughput sequence data.  

Getting Started  
Clone the repository:  
bash  
Copy code  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DIY-Transcriptomics.git  
Install dependencies:  
Follow the instructions in the requirements.txt file or the R setup script.  

Run the analysis:  
Execute the scripts or notebooks in the order provided to reproduce the analysis.  

Notes
This repository is a work in progress as I continue learning and updating the analysis.
Feel free to contribute or provide feedback!
